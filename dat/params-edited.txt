Ext axis 1-6, ext axis block allowable move after E-stop

Conventional
When the external block function is used, reactivation cannot be performed after emergency stop and an alarm occurs.  (Since axes which have block designation change some pulses from those at power off by emergency stop, alarm 1760 occurs when motion is attempted.)

Improved Contents (Version 4.2)
The external axis block allowable pulse value is set to this parameter and motion is possible in the moving amount of an axis with block designation is within the allowable value range.

Conventional
In the analog output function corresponding to speed, linear speed in motion is 
calculated in accordance with control point moving amount.  Therefore, when the 
manipulator operates at a high speed, linear speed is not stable even in the 
constant speed area.  This results in unstable analog output.

Improved Contents (After version 4.2)
To make anaolog output stable in the constant speed area, it is necessary to 
change the speed control method internally.  Therefore, when analog output 
function corresponding to speed is used, the speed control method can be 
changed by setting this parameter.
